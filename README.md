## Sales microservice

By polling the Inventory microservice, Sales was able to obtain a list of the automobiles on the site. Then, I created models for potential clients and employees. By connecting my 2 models and my value objects polled from inventory, I created a sales model. Then it was just about using my view functions to create forms and send the relevant http method.
